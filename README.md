# SkExtras
This plugin adds miscellaneous syntax to Skript for higher quality of life. It's basically just SkJade features.

> [!NOTE]
> I copied SkBee and SkJade for the plugin loader/other things. Most of the features of this plugin are copied features from SkJade, and I do want people to think that I'm blatantly copying SkJade for making my OWN skript addon when this is really just a addon I used for my own server for fun.
